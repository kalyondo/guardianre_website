Guardian Reinsurance Brokers Limited proudly joined the nation in commemorating **Zambia's 61st Independence Anniversary**, a milestone that reflects the country's enduring journey of resilience, unity, and determination.

## A Proud Zambian Heritage

As a Zambian-founded organisation established in 2006, Guardian Re draws inspiration from the nation's progress and remains committed to contributing to a resilient and prosperous Zambia.

Our founding as Zambia's first licensed reinsurance broker was driven by a vision to strengthen the local insurance market and reduce reliance on foreign intermediaries. This vision aligns with the broader national aspiration for economic self-determination and sustainable development.

## Building Resilience Together

Guardian Re recognises that sustainable economic growth is supported by strong institutions, responsible risk management, and collaborative partnerships across sectors.

### Our Contribution to National Development

- **Supporting Local Insurers**: Strengthening the capacity of Zambian insurance companies to underwrite significant risks
- **Retaining Value Locally**: Ensuring that reinsurance expertise and advisory services are available within Zambia
- **Building Professional Capacity**: Contributing to the development of skilled professionals in the reinsurance sector
- **Promoting Best Practices**: Upholding international standards while understanding local market dynamics

## Reaffirming Our Commitment

On this important occasion, Guardian Re reaffirms its commitment to supporting businesses, institutions, and communities through professional reinsurance brokerage services that promote stability and long-term growth.

We believe that a well-functioning insurance and reinsurance sector is fundamental to national development, providing the risk transfer mechanisms that enable businesses to invest, grow, and create employment.

## One Zambia, One Nation

As we celebrate 61 years of independence, Guardian Re stands with all Zambians in looking forward to continued progress, prosperity, and unity.

*Happy Independence Day, Zambia!*

*Guardian Re – Proudly Zambian, Globally Connected.*
