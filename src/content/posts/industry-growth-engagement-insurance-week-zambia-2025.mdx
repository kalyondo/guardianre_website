Guardian Reinsurance Brokers Limited participated in the launch of **Insurance Week Zambia 2025**, held under the theme *"Supporting Resilience in Communities."*

## A Growing Market

The event highlighted the continued growth of Zambia's insurance sector, which recorded approximately **14% growth in Gross Written Premium (GWP)** in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This encouraging trajectory reflects increasing awareness of insurance solutions and growing confidence in the sector.

For reinsurance brokers like Guardian Re, this growth translates into greater opportunities to support insurers in managing their expanding portfolios and underwriting more complex risks.

## The Role of Reinsurance in Market Development

As one of Zambia's leading reinsurance brokers, Guardian Re plays a critical role in supporting insurers to underwrite larger and more complex risks by providing structured reinsurance solutions that enhance balance sheet strength.

### How Reinsurance Supports Growth

- **Capacity Enhancement**: Enabling insurers to accept risks that would otherwise exceed their retention limits
- **Portfolio Optimisation**: Helping insurers balance their books and manage concentration risks
- **Financial Stability**: Providing protection against catastrophic losses that could impact solvency
- **Market Confidence**: Strengthening the overall resilience of the insurance ecosystem

## Navigating Regulatory Change

With new regulatory developments on the horizon, Guardian Re is proactively supporting insurers and clients in navigating change while promoting best practices that strengthen the industry as a whole.

Our team remains engaged with the **Pensions and Insurance Authority (PIA)** and industry stakeholders to ensure we can provide timely guidance to our clients on compliance matters.

## Acknowledgements

Guardian Re extends its appreciation to the **Insurers Association of Zambia (IAZ)** and the **Pensions and Insurance Authority (PIA)** for the successful launch of Insurance Week Zambia 2025.

Events like these reinforce the importance of collaboration in building a robust, sustainable insurance industry that truly supports resilience in Zambian communities.
