## Reinsurance Products and Solutions

Guardian Re provides access to a comprehensive range of reinsurance products designed to meet the risk transfer requirements of insurance companies operating in Zambia and across the African market. Our products are structured to provide appropriate protection while supporting efficient capital management.

## Treaty Reinsurance

Treaty reinsurance provides automatic coverage for a defined portfolio of risks, enabling insurers to manage their aggregate exposures and stabilise underwriting results.

### Proportional Treaties

**Quota Share**
Under quota share arrangements, the reinsurer assumes a fixed percentage of all risks within the defined portfolio. This approach provides capacity support, stabilises results, and facilitates portfolio growth.

- Suitable for new or expanding portfolios
- Provides consistent capacity across all risks
- Simplifies administration and reporting

**Surplus Share**
Surplus treaties allow cedants to retain a fixed amount on each risk and cede the surplus to reinsurers. This structure provides flexibility to manage large individual exposures while retaining smaller risks in full.

- Optimal retention of profitable smaller risks
- Capacity for larger risks as required
- Balances retention and cession efficiently

---

### Non-Proportional Treaties

**Excess of Loss (XOL)**
Excess of loss treaties protect cedants against individual losses or accumulations that exceed specified retention levels. Coverage responds only when losses breach the attachment point.

- Per-risk excess of loss for individual large losses
- Per-occurrence excess of loss for event accumulations
- Aggregate excess of loss for cumulative protection

**Stop Loss**
Stop loss treaties provide protection when aggregate losses for a portfolio exceed a defined loss ratio or monetary threshold. This structure protects against deterioration in overall underwriting performance.

- Protection against adverse experience
- Capital preservation during difficult periods
- Supports underwriting planning and budgeting

## Facultative Reinsurance

Facultative reinsurance provides coverage for individual risks on a case-by-case basis. Each risk is separately offered to and accepted by reinsurers, allowing for tailored terms and conditions.

### Applications

- Risks exceeding treaty capacity
- Unusual or complex exposures
- Risks outside treaty scope or class
- Large single-site concentrations

### Process

Guardian Re manages the full facultative placement process, from risk presentation through to binding and documentation. We ensure timely responses and competitive terms for each placement.
