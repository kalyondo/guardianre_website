The new wordpress theme called Consulting WP has been lauded by critics for its presentation. The theme is made by Style Mix Themes, who have been key players in the theme industry for a long time. People were excited to see what they would come up with next; their specialty has always been designing industry specific themes. This time they have focused on the consultation industry and have hit a home run.

There are many great things within the theme which are the cause of its popularity. The biggest factor is the appearance of the theme; it disrupts theme design clichés without being unprofessional. The different possible color combinations are also being appreciated by many companies. The theme continues to rise in popularity and many other companies have expressed an interest in deploying it on their new websites. The creators of the theme are happy with the response and have vowed to create further themes exploring the same concepts

- **Growth through innovation/creativity:**
Rather than be constrained by ideas for new products, services and new markets coming from just a few people, a Thinking Corporation can tap into the employees.

- **Increased profits:**
The corporation will experience an increase in profits due to savings in operating costs as well as sales from new products, services and ventures.

- **Higher business values:**
The link between profits and business value means that the moment a corporation creates a new sustainable level of profit, the business value is adjusted accordingly.

- **Lower staff turnover:**
This, combined with the culture that must exist for innovation and creativity to flourish, means that new employees will be attracted to the organization.
